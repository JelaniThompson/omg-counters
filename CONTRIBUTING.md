# How to contribute

We are always looking to add more frameworks to our list. The proper way to do this is to fork the repo, make your changes, and then submit a pull request. In your submission, make sure to run [doctoc](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc) on the README.md file in order to generate an up-to-date table of contents.

You can do this by installing [`doctoc`](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc) and then running:

```
doctoc README.md
```

Each example should also have a live example. It's recommended to make this live example on [WebpackBin](http://www.webpackbin.com/), but if your language/framework requires another sandbox, that should be viable as well.
